# connect-four
- highschool project, please ignore my complete lack of knowledge about c++
- originally created with visual studion 2014 (express edition or whatever the free version was)
- this is just the source code, I don't have the solution file anymore
- I haven't tried to make it compile (needs at least Windows.h)
